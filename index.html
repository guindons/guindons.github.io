            Outside of school on my own time I play volleyball and softball, (i am not currently on a team for those
            sports yet.) I also do horseback riding, at lone wolf farm. My sister and I are currently leasing a large
            pony. I have lived in Ottawa for around 2 years before I lived in Petawawa for 4 years. I have gone back and
            forth between Petawawa and Ottawa, but now will stay in Ottawa.

        <p1> Horseback Riding</p1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p2> I started riding when I was 9, in 2019. I started riding at a barn named "Canyon Creek Farm," and stayed
            there for around a year-year and a half. After I stopped ridin there I swithed to a barn called "Slow Horse
            Farm." When I got there I really like it and started to "lease a horse, Jack. I started bringing him to
            competitions and competed with him for 2 seasons. During our last season, we placed all firsts in our jumer
            show and two second places in western games.</p2>
